#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT Count(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(product)
FROM JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers AS Cust
INNER JOIN FebSales AS Feb
ON Cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product, MIN (price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM (quantity)*price AS Revenue, product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM FebSales AS Feb
INNER JOIN customers AS cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(Feb.orderID)=6
AND Feb.orderID<> 'Order ID';

#8. Which products were sold in Los Angeles in February, and how many of each product were sold?
SELECT distinct product, SUM(quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
